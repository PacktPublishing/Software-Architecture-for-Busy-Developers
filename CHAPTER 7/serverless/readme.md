Serverless Example
============
The instructions of this readme are the required steps to test the sample serverless application. Because serverless architectures are based on cloud offerings, I had to chose a cloud provider and went for Azure.
# K8s
If you already tested the microservices app, you can skip this step. Else, you can use any flavor of K8s. For non-Windows users, you can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). Windows and Mac users can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
You can of course rely on any cloud-based cluster. Make sure you create the application namespace.
